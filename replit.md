## Recent Changes

- **July 2026**: SEO readiness pass: set site domain in meta tags/canonical to https://tribal18.com; added robots.txt (allows all, disallows /admin, points to sitemap) and sitemap.xml (6 public pages) in client/public; created the missing og-image.png (1200x630 from the app screens image); added SoftwareApplication JSON-LD structured data to index.html; new useSEO hook (client/src/lib/seo.ts) sets unique title, description, canonical, and Open Graph/Twitter tags per page (home, contact, login, create-account, privacy, terms), with noindex on admin pages; in production the server also injects the same per-route meta tags into the served index.html (server/seo.ts + server/static.ts) so crawlers and social scrapers get correct tags on first fetch without running JavaScript (verified via local production build)
- **July 2026**: Added Privacy Policy page (/privacy), Terms & Conditions page (/terms) (both in client/src/pages/legal.tsx with shared dark-theme layout, header, and back button), and a cookie consent popup (client/src/components/cookie-consent.tsx, shown site-wide until Accept/Decline is chosen, remembered in localStorage under "tribal18-cookie-consent"); footer Privacy Policy / Terms links now point to the new pages ("Terms of Service" renamed "Terms & Conditions")

- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom plugins for Replit development experience
- **Color Theme**: Blue (#0ea5e9 sky) and Green (#22c55e emerald) for branding

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with:
- Pages in `client/src/pages/` (home.tsx, login.tsx, create-account.tsx, contact.tsx, benefit.tsx, admin.tsx, admin-login.tsx, not-found.tsx)
- Reusable UI components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Custom hooks in `client/src/hooks/`

The backend structure:

- **Migrations**: Managed via `drizzle-kit` with migrations output to `./migrations`

### Shared Code
The `shared/` directory contains code shared between frontend and backend:
- Database schema definitions
- TypeScript types derived from schema
- Zod validation schemas

### Build System
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, proxied through Express
- **Production Build**: Custom build script (`script/build.ts`) using:
  - Vite for client bundle (output to `dist/public`)
  - esbuild for server bundle (output to `dist/index.cjs`)
  - Selective dependency bundling to optimize cold start times

## External Dependencies
